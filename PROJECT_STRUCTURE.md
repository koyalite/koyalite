# Project Structure Explanation

## apps/

- These are interactive people-facing tools.
- Built for end users or admins.

## services/

- Microservices
- Programmatic backends, running as APIs or background workers.
- Each can be independently deployable
- May be containerized and scaled based on need
- May run in isolation, be deployed separately

## packages/

- Code reuse and abstraction (not deployable on their own)
- Shared libraries/utilities/modules used across multiple services or apps
- Holds:
    - Utility functions
    - CLI
    - Custom Configs (e.g., ESLint, tsconfig, etc)
    - Client SDKs
    - Prisma client, DB logic
    - Auth helpers
    - Logging setup
    - Types

## functions/

- User-defined edge, serverless functions
- Run in response to HTTP events or backend triggers
- Have access to the KoyaLite runtime context (e.g. auth, DB, etc)

## tests/

- Unit/E2E tests (using SQLite in-memory)

## docs/

- Documentation for the project, powered by Docusaurus.
- Includes guides, API references, CLI usage, and architecture breakdowns.
- Can be served locally for contributors or deployed for public access.

## docker/

- Contains Docker-related configurations for local development and deployment.
- Includes `compose.yml` for orchestrating services like `api`, `auth`, `storage`, and optional tools like `posthog` and `weaviate`.

## logs/

- Centralized location for logs generated by various services.
- Useful for debugging and monitoring.
- Can be integrated with tools like Grafana and Loki for visualization and analysis.

## .husky/

- Contains Git hooks for automating tasks like linting and formatting before commits.
- Ensures code quality and consistency across the team.

## .github/

- (Optional) Holds GitHub-specific configurations like workflows for CI/CD pipelines.
- Automates tasks like testing, building, and deploying the project.

## scripts/

- (Optional) Custom scripts for automating repetitive tasks like cleaning, seeding the database, or generating code.
- Can be used to simplify developer workflows.
