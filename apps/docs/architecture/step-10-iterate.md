# Step 10: Iterate & Refine

## Purpose

Design is never final — this step ensures that KoyaLite remains maintainable, adaptable, and continuously improved through community input, feedback loops, and structured iteration.

---

## Feedback Loops

- **Internal Dogfooding**: Use KoyaLite to build real apps (e.g., design tools, notes apps) to validate design decisions.

- **Community Issues/Discussions**: Prioritize GitHub issues, feedback from Discord/Discussions.

- **Beta Testing**: Recruit devs to use early builds and report issues/UX friction.

---

## Iteration Practices

- **Quarterly Roadmap Reviews**: Reassess features, priorities, tech debt.

- **Backwards Compatibility Policy**: Avoid breaking APIs or CLI commands unless in a major release.

- **Change Proposals (RFCs)**: Encourage contributors to propose structural or feature changes.

- **Automated Tests + Linting**: Ensure iterative changes don’t break baseline expectations.

---

## Growth Strategies

- **Open Source Contributions**: Use labels like good first issue, help wanted, and rfc to attract contributors.

- **Template + App Examples**: Provide official starters using KoyaLite (e.g., blog, CMS, analytics tool).

- **Plugin Exploration**: Consider scoped plugin/hook system in future if interest emerges.

---

## Ongoing Quality

- Maintain **test coverage** across all services

- Enforce **code style** via Prettier/ESLint

- Use **automated CI** to validate PRs

- Review **performance benchmarks** periodically
