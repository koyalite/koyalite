# Step 8: Plan for Scalability & Extensibility

## Purpose

This step ensures that KoyaLite can evolve, scale, and be extended over time to meet the demands of diverse applications, team sizes, and deployment models.

---

## Scaling Dimensions

**Horizontal Scaling (Runtime)**

- **Stateless Services**: Most services (API, Edge Functions, Auth) are stateless and can be scaled horizontally using Docker or Kubernetes.

- **Database Reads**: Support for LiteFS enables multi-region read replicas.

- **Edge Functions**: Can be deployed globally via Deno Deploy or Cloudflare Workers.

**Storage**

- **Object Storage**: Scales horizontally via SeaweedFSâ€™s volume and filer model.

- **Search Indexes**: Weaviate handles large-scale vector data with horizontal partitioning.

**Eventing & Workflows**

- Native support for **cron jobs** and **webhooks**

- Planned support for **async queues** and **event buses**

---

## Extensibility

**Internal Modularity**

- Services are cleanly separated (Auth, Project, RLS, Search, Email, etc.)

- Type-safe interfaces with support for mocking in tests

- CLI and Studio are decoupled and can be extended independently

**Optional Plugins** (Future Roadmap)

- While KoyaLite avoids enforcing a plugin system, the architecture supports hook-based lifecycle extensions for advanced users

**API-first & Introspectable**

- OpenAPI and GraphQL schemas are generated from the DB schema

- Self-hosted projects can modify or override resolvers and controllers

---

## Configurability

- Dev/staging/prod awareness

- Feature flags for experimental or enterprise features

- Project-scoped settings and limits

---

## Deployment Flexibility

- Docker Compose for single-node dev/test

- Kubernetes-ready with service modularity and health checks

- Potential Helm chart for simplified K8s deployment

- Scalable CLI-driven project scaffolding

---

## Maintainability Enablers

- Monorepo structure with strict boundaries per service

- Type safety and code linting throughout

- Workspace tooling and automated testing
